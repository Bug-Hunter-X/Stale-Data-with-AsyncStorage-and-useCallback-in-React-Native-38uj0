The solution involves moving the AsyncStorage data fetching logic into a useEffect hook and carefully managing its dependencies. By doing this, we ensure that the component re-renders whenever the AsyncStorage data changes. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@my_key');
      setData(value);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This revised code effectively fetches the data from AsyncStorage only once during component mount, avoiding the issues caused by useCallback's memoization.  The dependency array in useEffect is empty, ensuring that the effect only runs after the initial render.  This ensures that the `data` state will update correctly with the data fetched from AsyncStorage.
